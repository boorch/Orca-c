# ORCΛ

Orca is an [esoteric programming language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esoteric_programming_language) and live editor designed to quickly create procedural sequencers. Every letter of the alphabet is an operation, lowercase letters execute on `*bang*`, and uppercase letters execute each frame.

This is the C implementation of the [ORCΛ](https://wiki.xxiivv.com/site/orca.html) language and terminal livecoding environment. It's designed to be power efficient. It can handle large files, even if your terminal is small.

Orca is not a synthesizer, but a flexible livecoding environment capable of sending MIDI, OSC, and UDP to your audio/visual interfaces like Ableton, Renoise, VCV Rack, or SuperCollider.

# About this fork

I'll try to add new operators based on my needs. I'm not a professional programmer, just a hobbyist, so most of the code here is generated by ChatGPT, based on 'painfully' extensive directions I provided. I've tried to include comments as much as possible to remember what I did and why, but I'm fairly certain it's not the most elegant code that adheres to proper standards. You should consider this fork to be 'somewhat' functional. Currently I'm focused on Orca-c only, since it's the main variant I use (on my Raspberry Pi Zero 2W, connected to my iPad Pro 11", accessed through SSH, and outputting notes through USB, acting as a MIDI Gadget).

## Scale Operator (^):
Outputs "note" based on the provided root note and scale.

| RootNote | Scale | Operator | Degree |
|:--------:|:-----:|:--------:|:------:|
|    R     |   S   |    ^     |   D    |

Example:
- 01^2
- Input '0': C
- Input '1': minor
- Input '2': 3rd
- Output: 'd' (D#)



| Degree | Scale               |
|:-----:|--------------------------|
|   0   | Major Scale              |
|   1   | Minor Scale              |
|   2   | Major Pentatonic Scale   |
|   3   | Minor Pentatonic Scale   |
|   4   | Blues Major Scale        |
|   5   | Blues Minor Scale        |
|   6   | Lydian Scale             |
|   7   | Whole Scale              |
|   8   | Diminished Scale         |
|   9   | Super Locrian Scale      |
|   a   | Locrian Scale            |
|   b   | Phrygian Scale           |
|   c   | Neapolitan Minor Scale   |
|   d   | Neapolitan Major Scale   |
|   e   | Hex Phrygian Scale       |
|   f   | Pelog Scale              |
|   g   | Spanish Scale            |
|   h   | Bhairav Scale            |
|   i   | Ahirbhairav Scale        |
|   j   | Augmented2 Scale         |
|   k   | Purvi Scale              |
|   l   | Marva Scale              |
|   m   | Enigmatic Scale          |
|   n   | Scriabin Scale           |
|   o   | Indian Scale             |

## MidiChord Operator (|):
Extension of Midi operator with 3 input notes. The first note processed is always considered the root note. Every following note is assumed to be "higher" than the previous one. (So no chord inversions sorry)

| Midichord | Channel | Octave | Note 1 | Note 2 | Note 3 | Velocity | Duration |
|:---------:|:-------:|:------:|:------:|:------:|:------:|:--------:|:--------:|
|     \|     |    C    |    O   |   N1   |   N2   |   N3   |    V     |    D     |

Example 1:
- |03CEGff
- Plays C3 E3 G3

Example 2:
- |03GECff
- Plays G3 E3 C4

Example 3:
- |03CCCff
- Plays C3 C4 C5


## Random Unique Operator ($):
Requires bang. Similar to the Random Operator, but designed to avoid producing identical outputs on consecutive bangs in a creative (in other words, "hacky") manner.
